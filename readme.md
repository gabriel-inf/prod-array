## List multiplication problem

Given one list, create a function that returns another list where each position corresponds to the multiplication of all other numbers in the list exept for the one with the same index in the original list.

### Example:

    Input = [1,2,3]
    Output = [6,3,2]

 ### Solution: 

I wrote two solutions. The original solution that I coded in the first time looking to the problem which resulted in a bad complexity of O(nÂ²). The second solution is optimized and runs in O(n).
